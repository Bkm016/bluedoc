Sometimes you want numbered lists:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

@someone Hello there.

## Sometimes you want bullet points:

* Start a line with a star
* Profit!

**Alternatively,**

- Dashes work just as well
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
  - Like this
  - And this

```rb
BookLab::Markdown.render("Hello **world**")
```
