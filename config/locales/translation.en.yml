# THIS FILE CONTAINS LOCALIZATION KEYS : date and number formats, number precisions,
# number separators and all non-textual values depending on the language.
# These values must not reach the translator, so they are separated in this file.
#
# More info here: https://translation.io/blog/gettext-is-better-than-rails-i18n#localization
#
# You can edit and/or add new localization keys here, they won't be touched by Translation.io.
#
# If you want to add a new localization key prefix, use the option described here:
# https://github.com/translation/rails#custom-localization-key-prefixes
